And today, January 6, 2024, marks the 10th anniversary of the opening of YotioSoft on January 6, 2014.

Well, it is our 10th anniversary. As one would expect, it has been a long time, not "in the blink of an eye," but I think we have spent some meaningful years amidst all the twists and turns. I feel that we were only active for the first few years, but we continued to develop something every year, and we have continued to be active for 10 years. This is thanks to all of you. I am grateful for your support.

# Archive site is now open

I was actually thinking of making some kind of game to commemorate the event, but due to a lack of ideas and the unfortunate timing of the deadline for submitting my paper to the conference in a few days, I was unable to find the time to devote to the development of the game. So instead, I created an archive site looking back over the past 10 years.

Actually, I realized last night that I had not prepared anything and hurriedly made it based on YotioSoft's HP template. My lack of planning hasn't changed in 10 years. I made it while fishing through backup folders and archives of past articles and screenshots.

# Conclusion

Through our activities over the past 10 years, we have met many different people. I was exposed to a variety of ideas, thoughts and works, which provided me with good stimulation. It has also encouraged me to continue my activities. Thank you very much for everything.

Thank you for your continued support of YotioSoft.
